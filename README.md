> **"Trust Us with you NETWORK."** — Vox.

## 📄 About The Project
**CyberChronos OS** is a conceptual operating system designed for the next generation of digital integration. Developed under the banner of **VoxTek Enterprises**, this project showcases a web-based landing page for an OS that prioritizes speed, aesthetics, and total media control.

Inspired by the universe of *Hazbin Hotel* (specifically the Media Demon, Vox), this site serves as the official presentation portal for the software running on the **CyberChronos 14 Pro** laptop.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Immersive UI:** A dark, neon-infused design language (Cyan/Red/Black) reflecting Vox's aesthetic.
* **Glitch Effects:** CSS-based animations simulating CRT interference and digital instability.
* **Responsive Design:** Looks terrifyingly good on both desktop monitors and mobile datapads.
* **Neuro-Sync Branding:** Presentation of fictional technologies like direct brain-to-web interfaces.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **HTML5:** Semantic structure.
* **CSS3:** Advanced animations (Keyframes), Flexbox/Grid layout, Backdrop filters.
* **JavaScript:** Minimal logic for scroll effects and UI interaction.
* **Fonts:** `Rajdhani` (UI) and `Fira Code` (Terminal snippets).
